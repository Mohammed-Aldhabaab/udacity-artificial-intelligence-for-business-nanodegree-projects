## 📋Project Description
This repository is to show up all my 3 projects under Udacity AI for the business Nanodegree program.
- Project 1: Created a Medical Image Annotation Job, With the lesson Creating a Dataset.
In this project, I had given a dataset ([Kaggle chest x-ray dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)) and business goal, I designed my own data labeling job using Appen's platform.
 
- Project 2: Built a Model with Google AutoML.
In this project, I built a classification model to classify images of chest X-rays ([Kaggle chest x-ray dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia))
using Google AutoML, an automated machine learning tool.

- Project 3: Developed a capstone proposal for vehicle identification.
